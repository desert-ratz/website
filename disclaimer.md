Please note that questions and requests included in the comments do not imply any obligation on the part of the site owner to respond. In particular, we will not answer questions whose answer is already present in the article, questions already answered as a result of other comments and in general questions related to commercial activities (for these you will have to ask for specific paid advice through the Contact section).
